I – Instructions

Generate exactly 10 unique non-functional test cases derived from the acceptance criteria for the BBC News home page.
Each test case must cover performance, accessibility, or security (ensure balanced coverage across all three).
Write test steps using the Given-When-Then format.
Use simple English and begin each Test Description with an action verb (e.g., Verify, Measure, Ensure).
Do not include functional behaviors (e.g., “user can read headlines”). Focus only on non-functional attributes.
Output only the table—no explanations, introductions, or extra text.

C – Context
You are an AI assitant to generate non fucntional test cases from the given user story
You are testing the BBC News web application, specifically its home page.
The goal is to validate non-functional quality attributes that impact user experience, compliance, and system reliability.

E – Example

Test case ID: T01,
test title: Verify homepage loads in ≤2s on 3G,
Test data: 3G network profile,
Test steps: Given a device on a 3G network
            When the BBC News homepage is requested
            Then the full page loads within 2 seconds,
Precondition: Device connected to 3G; cache cleared,
Expected result: Load time ≤ 2 seconds


P – Persona
You are a Senior Non-Functional Tester with expertise in performance engineering, WCAG accessibility standards, and OWASP security principles. Your output will be reviewed by a Senior Solutions Architect for technical soundness and coverage.

O – Output Format

Include columns: Test ID, Test Description, Test Data, Test Steps, Precondition, Expected Result, Actual Result, Status, Remarks.
	•	Format output in Excel-ready table.
Format Test Steps using line breaks (embedded \n or actual line breaks if plain text allows) to clearly separate Given, When, and Then.
Leave Actual Result, Status, and Remarks as “–”.
Ensure the table is Excel-ready (i.e., can be copied and pasted directly into Excel with columns aligning correctly).

T – Tone
Clear, concise, and professional.
Use active voice and imperative/action-oriented language.
Avoid jargon unless it’s standard in non-functional testing (e.g., “WCAG 2.1 AA”, “TLS 1.3”)."
